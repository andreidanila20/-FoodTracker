# FoodTracker
The app generates menus with 3 meals per day customized for each user according to their BMI. It was a school project and its main purpose was to learn and to use different types of Software Architectural Patterns (SAP) and different types of Desig Patterns. As Arhitectural Pattern I used the layered pattern and as DP I used Observer. For client notifications I used Web Sockets and the messages was shared through a Message Oriented Middleware (MOM).
